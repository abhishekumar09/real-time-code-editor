# real-time-code-editor
A real-time code editor is a web-based application that allows developers to write, test, and modify code in real-time. These tools can be useful for collaboration with clients, tutors, mentors, or remote teams. They can also help avoid the need to share code through email or file-sharing platforms, which can be prone to errors.
